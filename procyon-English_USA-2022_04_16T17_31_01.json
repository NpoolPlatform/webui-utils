This is possible because the first-batch of miners has already acquired hash power through the testnet prior to the launch of the mainnet. Once mainnet goes live, these miners are the first to begin the mining process, achieving much         <strong>greater ROI while the mining difficulty is low and the mining output is high</strong>.       </p>       <p>There are two core factors that affect a miner's ROI:</p>       <ul>         <li>1. Mining output</li>         <li>2. Token price</li>       </ul>       <p>Mining output is directly related to the mining difficulty. The more miners, the greater the total network-wide hash power, the higher the mining difficulty, and the lower the mining output per miner. The total mineable supply is fixed, so the more hash power that flows into mining, the less mining output is released per unit (TB) of hash power. The output of first-batch mining is usually much greater in comparison to regular mining. You can think of it like sharing a pizza. The more people share, the smaller each slice gets. For example, with Chia mining, the daily output during first-batch mining was equivalent to 1 year of mining at the rates just 2 months after mainnet launch.</p>","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"9cec03fe-d1d7-4639-8a06-4b41f5970acd","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_WALLET_ADDRESS_LABELS_TIP","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"e.g. name, exchange, etc.","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"be5c0c88-e520-4224-84f0-2b9b13fc4f4e","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_WALLET_ADDRESS_LABELS","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Wallet Label:","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"8b63bad8-7c9a-40e2-9370-ba329dc835e7","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_WALLET_ADDRESS_CAUTION_CONTENT","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"<ul>                         <li>Make sure you enter the correct address. <strong>Using an incorrect address will result in the loss of assets.</strong></li>                         <li>Make sure that <strong>the address matches the selected blockchain</strong>.

Is PRCN Technology Ltd. a company set up just for this platform? Are you backed by any large capital investors?</h3>       <p>As with the whole cryptocurrency industry, PRCN Technology is a relatively new venture. We understand if you feel that such a new field of investment deserves scrutiny. However, please know that our team has over a decade of collective industry experience in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.</p>       <h3>I see that the company is registered offshore in Seychelles, Africa. Is this for tax incentive purposes?</h3>       <p>As you may know, some countries are more friendly than others to the new industry of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Seychelles was selected for its crypto-friendly policies.</p>       <h3>Where are Procyon’s mining servers located?</h3>       <p>Currently, our mining servers are located in Hong Kong.</p>       <h3>What happens in the event of a flood or blackout in Hong Kong? Will my mining machine be okay?</h3>       <p>Hong Kong has one of the best electricity reliability rankings in the world, <a href='https://www.hkelectric.com/en/our-operations/supply-reliability' target='_blank'>as you can see from the official Hong Kong Electric website</a>.</p>       <h3>In case the server is damaged by a natural disaster, or is subject to robbery, Procyon is responsible for compensation, right?</h3>       <p>As indicated in Clause 6.7 of our entrustment agreement, Party A cannot be responsible for natural disasters such as a typhoon. As for Party A's responsibility to prevent robbery, that is part of our duty to our customers.</p>       <h3>What is the \"Technical Service Fee?\"</h3>       <p>The technical service fee covers the maintenance and operation costs of your mining machine, and is deducted from your daily mining rewards.</p>       <h3>Does Procyon have a mobile app?</h3>       <p>We plan to launch an official mobile app for our platform in the future, but will first launch on our browser-based website.</p>       <h2>Platform Functions and Troubleshooting</h2>       <h3>Does the platform include some sort of wallet function as well? Do I need to open an account?</h3>       <p>Yes. All of your mining rewards will be deposited directly into your Procyon wallet, which is unique to you and automatically created when you register an account on our platform.</p>       <h3>How do I sell my mining rewards or convert them into other currencies?</h3>       <p>Mining rewards will be distributed to your Procyon account's wallet, which you can then transfer to the wallet of the cryptocurrency exchange of your choice and freely trade or sell them however you wish.</p>       <h3>What happens if I have a Google Authenticator linked to my account, but I lose my phone?</h3>       <p>We strongly recommend all users to save their Google backup codes in a safe location offline (such as on a piece of paper) so that the account can be recovered in the event that their phone is lost or stolen. If you cannot access your Google Authenticator, please <a href='#/contact'>contact us</a> and we will help you through the process of unbinding your Google Authenticator from your account.</p>       <h2>Payments, Contracts, and Receipts</h2>       <h3>When does my contract period officially begin? From the date I signed it?</h3>       <p>Your contract period begins from the date your machine begins mining.</p>       <h3>My contract and receipt show the payment amount in USDT, but I paid with BTC. Why is this?</h3>       <p>Due to the daily price fluctuation of BTC and other cryptocurrencies, our sales partners convert payments to USDT (also known as Tether) — a stablecoin whose price is fixed to the US Dollar and does not fluctuate. This is to maintain stability and accuracy for our customers' payments. For any specific inquiries about your payment amount, please <a href='#/contact'>contact us</a></p>       <h3>I see the term \"TiB\" written in my contract, but I don't quite understand what that means.</h3>       <p>TiB stands for Terabyte, a unit used to measure computer hard disk storage space. For cryptocurrencies mined via hard disk space, such as Spacemesh, the storage power (also known as hash power for non-storaged based cryptocurrency mining) is measured in units of TiB.</p>       <h3>I don’t know much about digital currencies. Can you explain how Japanese tax law works regarding Digital Assets?</h3>       <p>For a detailed breakdown on Japanese Digital Currency Tax Law, please <a href='https://www.freee.co.jp/kb/kb-kakuteishinkoku/virtual_currency_tax/' target='_blank'>refer to the information provided here</a>.</p>       <h2>Spacemesh &amp; Spacemesh Mining</h2>       <h3>What is Spacemesh?</h3>       <p>Spacemesh is an open-source programmable cryptocurrency platform powered by a novel proof-of-space-time (PoST) consensus protocol. Spacemesh does not use proof-of-stake (PoS) or proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, thus it avoids some of their inherent issues, such as massive energy waste and centralization of mining power.</p>       <p>Spacemesh is designed to achieve three main objectives:</p>       <ul>         <li>Create and maintain the ledger for the Spacemesh coin (SMH). Spacemesh is a fair cryptocurrency and a global means of payment.</li>         <li>Ensure fair, wide distribution of SMH.</li>         <li>Establish a global programmable infrastructure for tokenized apps, communities and economies.</li>       </ul>       <h3>Who is building Spacemesh?</h3>       <p>Spacemesh was created by a top-class team of leaders and developers with decades of experience in startups, blockchain, and venture captial investing.</p>       <p>The co-founders, Tomer Afek and Aviv Eyal, have founded numerous startup ventures which went on to be acquired by the likes of Sony and Taboola.</p>       <h3>Who is backing Spacemesh?</h3>       <p>In September 2018, Spacemesh concluded a massive $18.5 million investment round led by Polychain Capital, with another round raising $4 million, bringing the total fundraising amount to over $22.5 million.</p>       <p>Other notable Spacemesh backer, Paradigm capital, has previously invested in hugely successful startups and large organizations, such as Uniswap, Coinbase, and Amber Group (leading crypto asset management firm).</p>       <p>Since 2012, Coinbase Ventures, a VC arm under Coinbase, and as of March 2021 is considered the largest exchange in the U.S by trading volume and 3rd largest worldwide.</p>       <p>Furthermore, in an unprecedented announcement on June 12th, 2020, Japanese mobile game and venture capital giant gumi Inc., through its blockchain-focused subsidiary gumi Cryptos Capital, unveiled their partnership with Spacemesh’s parent company, Unruly Technologies Ltd., to assist with market entry in Japan.</p>       <h3>When will the Spacemesh network officially launch?</h3>       <p>At the moment, the Spacemesh mainnet launch is scheduled for early 2022, but no specific date has been decided as of yet. We will notify all registered users of any updates regarding the Spacemesh mainnet launch as soon as new information becomes available.</p>       <h3>When will I start receiving Spacemesh mining rewards?</h3>       <p>If you purchased TB from the exclusive first mining batch, you will begin receiving rewards the day the Spacemesh main network launches.</p>       <h3>On which exchanges will Spacemesh be listed?</h3>       <p>SMH is certain to be on Coinbase as Coinbase directly invested in the project. It will also definitely be listed on Huobi and OKEx, and is very likely to be listed on Binance as well.</p>       <h2>Mining &amp; General Cryptocurrency Information</h2>       <h3>What is mining?</h3>       <p>'Mining' is the term used to describe how cryptocurrencies are produced. In order to \"mine\" a cryptocurrency, computers must solve complex mathematicl equations and if successful, the operators of the computers (also known as mining machines) are given cryptocurrency as a reward.</p>       <p>Much like mining for gold, it takes effort to procure (in the case of cryptocurrencies, computing power or hard disk space), there is a finite supply, and the more that is mined, or the more people attempt to mine it at the same time, the more difficult it is to mine more (this is known as Mining Difficulty, explained below).</p>       <h3>What is a mining pool?</h3>       <p>A 'mining pool' is a large-scale cryptocurrency mining operation that combines a large number of mining machines together to increase their probability of finding a 'block' on the blockchain and thus gaining cryptocurrencies as a reward (explained below).</p>       <h3>What is a Block?</h3>       <p>A block is like a page in a bank transaction ledger, which records all past and present transactions on a blockchain and can not be changed. Computers around the world are constantly recording these transactions, and when a block is completed, rewards are given out as an incentive for miners to continue validating the blockchain.</p>       <p>The more computing power you have, the greater your chances of gaining block rewards become.</p>       <h3>What is Mining Difficulty?</h3>       <p>Mining Difficulty refers to the rate at which cryptocurrencies can be mined. Much like mining for gold in the real world, the more miners, the greater the total network-wide hash power, the higher the mining difficulty, and the lower the mining output per miner. The total mineable supply is fixed, so the more hash power that flows into mining, the less mining output is released per unit (TB) of hash power. The mining output of the first-batch mining is usually much greater in comparison to regular mining as a result.</p>       <h3>What is a cryptocurrency wallet? What is a cold wallet? What is the difference?</h3>       <p>A cryptocurrency 'wallet' is where your digital currencies are kept, much in the same way you keep fiat currency cash in your wallet in your pocket. Normal online wallets, known as 'hot' wallets, store your cryptocurrencies online. 'Cold' wallets, or hardware wallets, are physical devices that store your cryptocurrencies offline. Though more secure than online 'hot' wallets, if a 'cold' wallet is damaged or lost, the digital assets inside are lost forever.</p>","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"b647eeae-ae39-494b-becd-ad316978577a","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_FAQ","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"FAQs","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"ab26814d-b3cc-479a-b9ed-f756b133b158","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_FAMALE","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Female","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"574cbf90-02a9-40d1-9426-fb1a5d2b5a56","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EXPORT_ORDER_CSV","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Export Daily Output (CSV)","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"55c1adac-9022-4665-90ec-48f562c5c9ac","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EXPORT_DAILY_OUTPUT_CSV","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Export Daily Output (CSV)","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"79652f09-504e-4d41-a2ec-58e31fa26139","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_ENABLE_2FA_AUTH","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Enable Two-Factor Auth","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"b317fce5-ee8f-4c00-b82a-c90cbc505266","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_CODE","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"E-mail Verification Code","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"117e9c84-b98c-4f5a-87af-c2d654302c96","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_CAPTION","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Please enter the verification code we set to your email,","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"aa23ce78-fc1c-4abf-806d-f0a9e938e324","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_VERIFICATION","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Email Verification","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"d62ab214-0ea1-40b0-a8d2-52302381608f","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_TIP","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Please fill email address","BatchGet":true},{"ID":"201c7b46-5e8d-4bd3-813e-0e476a8c4318","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"email","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"4278f885-540e-486e-b123-6e1fd5b48487","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_LOGIN_AUTHENTICATION","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"E-mail Login Verification","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"824b1ecd-31da-45de-b832-16c461b14bb5","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EMAIL_ADDRESS","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"E-mail Address","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"d5d0fe5e-7b16-434e-a046-d9a88d76b634","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_EARNINGS","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Earnings","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"a218cdc8-5d28-4cc0-bbf3-db8a843d2f2a","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_DREAM_TEAM_TITLE","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Dream Team","BatchGet":false},{"ID":"afcdd1e3-1e0e-497b-9efe-6bd5ea6c22ff","AppID":"ff2c5d50-be56-413e-aba5-9c7ad888a769","MessageID":"MSG_DREAM_TEAM","LangID":"8b86f559-4784-4079-8da2-238423436f10","Message":"Procyon’s founders have over 10 years of cryptocurrency market experience with a track record that includes investment projects with average ROI of over 100x.
